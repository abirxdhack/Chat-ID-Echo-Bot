## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up the bot, ensure you have the following:

- **Python 3.9+**: The bot is written in Python.
- **Telegram API Credentials**: You’ll need an `API_ID` and `API_HASH` from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
- **Bot Token**: Create a bot via [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram to get a `BOT_TOKEN`.
- **Telethon Library**: The bot uses Telethon to interact with Telegram’s API.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abirxdhack/Chat-ID-Echo-Bot.git
   cd Chat-ID-Echo-Bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install telethon
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Credentials**:
   Open `quickinfo.py` and replace the placeholder credentials with your own:
   ```python
   API_ID = 28239710  # Replace with your API ID
   API_HASH = '7fc5b35692454973318b86481ab5eca3'  # Replace with your API Hash
   BOT_TOKEN = '7671261830:AAEW7B_Wd406rBvbEwUiW4uPlHJumUokXaY'  # Replace with your Bot Token
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Bot**:
   Start the bot by running the script:
   ```bash
   python3 quickinfo.py
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   ✅ Bot is running... Press Ctrl+C to stop.
   ```

2. **Interact with the Bot**:
   - Open Telegram and start a chat with your bot (find it using the username you set via BotFather).
   - Send the `/start` command to see the welcome message and keyboard.
   - Click a button (e.g., "👤 User", "🔒 Private Group", or "🌐 Public Channel") and share the requested entity.
   - The bot will reply with the chat ID, e.g.:
     ```
     👤 Shared User Info
     🆔 ID: 5857628904
     ```

## 📜 Code Structure

- **`quickinfo.py`**: The main script containing the bot logic, including the event handlers for `/start` and peer sharing.
- **Logging**: The bot uses Python’s `logging` module to log events, making it easy to debug issues.
